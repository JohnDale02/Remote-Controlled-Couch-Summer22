# Bluetooth Electric Couch

__Overview:__
The Remote Control 3-Seater Couch Vehicle was an ambitious and innovative endeavor undertaken during the Summer of 2022 by a passionate team of engineering enthusiasts, my twin brother and I. The primary goal of this project was to design, build, and create a fully functional, remote-controlled couch vehicle capable of traveling up to 5 miles on a single charge while carrying 1000 lbs. This unique project was not only an exciting engineering challenge but also an opportunity to expand knowledge and skills in various disciplines including embedded programming, circuit design, and power distribution.
