# Electric Couch Vehicle

## Overview

The Electric Couch Vehicle is an innovative project that merges comfort with mobility, resulting in a one-of-a-kind electric driving couch. Built entirely from scratch, this project showcases a custom 72V 40Ah Li-ion battery pack made from 18650 cells, achieving a range of 5 miles per charge and a top speed of 15 MPH. It's controlled wirelessly via a Bluetooth-connected PS4 controller and is programmed primarily in C++.

### Project Duration

**June 2022 â€“ August 2022**

## Features

- **Custom 72V 40Ah Li-ion Battery:** Built from 320 18650 cells spot welded together by hand to design a custom 20s16p lithium-ion battery pack.
- **Wireless Control:** Operated using a Bluetooth PS4 controller for an intuitive driving experience.
- **Dynamic Functionality:** Programmed features include electric steering and braking, dynamic throttle control, reverse, lights, and horn.
- **Advanced Components:** Integration of digital potentiometers, LL duplex shifters, MOSFETs, DC-DC buck converters, and more.

## Implementation and Code

The project emphasized designing and fabricating a working prototype rather than developing advanced software. The code provided here serves the basic functionality required to operate the vehicle, including steering, throttle control, and auxiliary functions. It was developed in C++ and is structured to provide a straightforward, implementation-focused approach to vehicle control.
